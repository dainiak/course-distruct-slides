            If \(\bbF\) is a field, \(P\in \bbF[x]\) and \(\deg P = d\), then \(P\) has at most \(d\) roots.

            If \(a\) is a root of polynomial \(P\in \bbF[x]\), and \(\deg P = d\),
            then \(P\) is divisible by \((x-a)\), that is \(P=(x-a)\cdot Q\),
            where \(\deg Q = d-1\).
        </p>
        <p class="proof fragment">
            By the inductive hypothesis, \(Q\) has at most \(d-1\) roots,
            therefore \(P\) has at most \(d\) roots.
